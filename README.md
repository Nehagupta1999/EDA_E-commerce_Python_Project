# EDA_E-commerce_Python_Project

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sample E-commerce Superstore dataset to uncover valuable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. Using Python, the project provides a framework for analyzing and visualizing key business metrics to aid data-driven decision-making.

The dataset contains detailed records of orders, shipping details, customer information, and sales metrics, with columns such as:
- **Order Priority**
- **Discount**
- **Unit Price**
- **Shipping Cost**
- **Customer Segment**
- **Product Category**
- **Order Year**
- And more...

The goal is to derive actionable insights for decision-making and provide a framework for analysing sales performance, customer segmentation, and profitability.
